## GameStore Overview

The "GameStore" app is a Laravel-based platform designed for users to store, view, and purchase games while efficiently managing their profiles. Leveraging Laravel's MVC architecture, Eloquent ORM, and robust security features, the app provides a dynamic interface using Blade templates. Users can seamlessly add games, simulate purchases, review purchase history, and manage their profiles.

## Laravel Framework Features

Built on the Laravel framework, the GameStore app benefits from a powerful and expressive web application framework. Laravel simplifies common tasks in web development, offering features such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel ensures accessibility, power, and provides essential tools for building large, robust applications.
